# podproxy — CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

A self-hosted Go podcast caching proxy. Podcast apps add a proxied RSS URL; the server rewrites enclosure URLs to point at itself, then stream-caches episodes to disk on first play. Future plays (and other devices) are served from local cache.

## Architecture

```
Podcast App → /feeds/:id.rss       → rewritten RSS with proxy URLs
Podcast App → /episodes/:feed/:ep  → write-through stream cache
```

**Key subsystems:**

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `internal/config` | YAML config loading with defaults |
| `internal/db` | SQLite CRUD for feeds and episodes |
| `internal/feed` | RSS fetching/parsing, background poller, prefetch worker pool |
| `internal/proxy` | Episode handler: cache hit → `http.ServeContent`; miss → `io.TeeReader` stream-while-caching |
| `internal/api` | REST API handlers |
| `internal/backup` | On-demand and scheduled database backups via `VACUUM INTO` |
| `internal/ui` | HTMX web UI with embedded HTML templates |

## Data Model

Two SQLite tables: `feeds` and `episodes`. Episode `cache_status` is one of: `none`, `in_progress`, `cached`, `failed`. Feeds have an `auto_prefetch` boolean flag.

Episode files live at `{cache_dir}/episodes/{feed_id}/{url_id}`. Feed XML is cached at `{cache_dir}/feeds/{feed_id}.xml`.

## API Endpoints

```
POST   /api/feeds                       Add a feed by RSS URL
GET    /api/feeds                       List all feeds with stats
DELETE /api/feeds/:id                   Remove feed and purge cached files
POST   /api/feeds/:id/refresh           Force RSS re-fetch (regenerates cached XML)
POST   /api/feeds/:id/prefetch          Queue uncached episodes within age window
POST   /api/feeds/:id/bulk-cache        Queue specific episodes by URL ID (body: {"episode_ids": [...]})
POST   /api/backups                     Trigger an immediate database backup
GET    /api/backups                     List existing backups (name, size, created_at)
POST   /ui/feeds/:id/bulk-cache         UI: queue selected uncached episodes for download
POST   /ui/feeds/:id/bulk-delete        UI: delete cached files for selected episodes
GET    /feeds/:id.rss                   Proxied RSS feed (used by podcast apps)
GET    /episodes/:feed_id/:ep_id        Episode audio proxy / cache server
GET    /health                          Server status and disk usage
GET    /ui                              HTMX web interface
```

## Build & Run

```bash
go build -o podproxy .
./podproxy                     # looks for config.yaml in CWD; falls back to defaults
```

Config file is optional — defaults work for local development (port 8080, `./cache`, `./data`).

## Docker

```bash
cp deploy/config.yaml.example config.yaml   # edit base_url
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Multi-arch image (amd64 + arm64). Volumes: `podproxy-data` (SQLite) and `podproxy-cache` (episode audio). CGO is disabled (pure Go SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite`).

## Key Implementation Details

- **Write-through caching:** `io.TeeReader` streams origin response to client and disk simultaneously. Never buffers full file in memory. Episode reset to `none` on client disconnect.
- **Range requests on uncached episodes:** Range is proxied to the client; a background goroutine fetches and caches the full file.
- **Concurrency:** A `sync.Map` of per-episode mutexes prevents duplicate concurrent writes.
- **Prefetch worker pool:** Bounded channel + N goroutines (default 2). Retries with 5s/30s backoff.
- **Auto-prefetch:** Per-feed toggle; poller automatically queues new episodes after each refresh.
- **Feed poller:** Single goroutine ticks every minute, checks which feeds are past their `refresh_interval_minutes`. Regenerates RSS cache when new episodes arrive.
- **HTTP/2 disabled** on upstream transport to prevent CDN connection resets.
- **Bulk select mode:** UI episode list has an opt-in "Select" button that reveals checkboxes and bulk toolbar. "Cache Selected" targets `none`/`failed` episodes; "Delete Cached" targets `cached` episodes only. Both are enforced server-side — wrong-status episodes are silently skipped.
- **Database backups:** `VACUUM INTO` produces a consistent, defragmented snapshot safe to take while live. `backup.Manager` handles on-demand creation, rotation (keeps newest N, deletes tail), and an optional scheduled ticker. `Stop()` uses `sync.Once` to allow safe multiple calls.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for planned future features.
